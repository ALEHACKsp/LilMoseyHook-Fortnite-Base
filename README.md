# LilMoseyHook-Fortnite-Base

**Credits :**
- Godfather Fortnite Source
- This is just a wombo-combo paste, it is prett organised though anyway, i tried making name spacing consistent but with all the garbage in the godfather source i got bored about 90% of the way through (you will see yourself xD)
